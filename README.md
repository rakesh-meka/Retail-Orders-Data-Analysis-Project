## 🚀 **Project Workflow**
### 🔹 **Data Extraction**
- The dataset was imported from **Kaggle** using the Kaggle API.
- The data was loaded directly into **Jupyter Notebook** for further processing.

### 🔹 **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- The data was examined for **missing values**, **duplicates**, and **incorrect data types**.
- Unnecessary columns were removed, and the data was formatted for improved readability.

### 🔹 **Data Storage**
- The cleaned and transformed data was exported to **Microsoft SQL Server**.
- SQL Server was connected via **Jupyter Notebook** to facilitate seamless data migration.

### 🔹 **Data Analysis and Insights**
#### 📊 **Key SQL Analysis Questions**
- 🔸 **Top 10 revenue-generating categories and subcategories**
- 🔸 **Top 5 highest-selling products in each region**
- 🔸 **Month-over-month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sales**
- 🔸 **Identifying the month with the highest sales for each category**
- 🔸 **Category with the highest growth percentage in profit in 2023 compared to 2022**
- 🔸 **Subcategory with the highest growth percentage in profit in 2023 compared to 2022**
- 🔸 **Top 5 states with the highest sales**

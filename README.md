# 🛒 **Retail Orders Data Analysis Project**

## 🎯 **Project Title**
**Retail Orders Analysis and Data Pipeline with SQL Integration**

## 📋 **Project Description**
This project involves analyzing retail orders data sourced from **Kaggle**. The data was downloaded as a **ZIP file** through the **Kaggle API**, extracted using code in **Jupyter Notebook**, then cleaned, transformed, and loaded into **Microsoft SQL Server**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate data wrangling, transformation, and visualization skills while maintaining a robust data pipeline workflow.

## 🚀 **Project Workflow**
### 🔹 **Data Extraction**
- The dataset was imported from **Kaggle** using the Kaggle API.
- The dataset was downloaded as a **ZIP file**, extracted using Python code in **Jupyter Notebook**.
- The data was loaded directly into **Jupyter Notebook** for further processing.

### 🔹 **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- The data was examined for **missing values**, **duplicates**, and **incorrect data types**.
- Unnecessary columns were removed, and the data was formatted for improved readability.

### 🔹 **Data Storage**
- The cleaned and transformed data was exported to **Microsoft SQL Server**.
- SQL Server was connected via **Jupyter Notebook** to facilitate seamless data migration.

### 🔹 **Data Analysis and Insights**
#### 📊 **Key SQL Analysis Questions**
  🔸 **Top 10 revenue-generating categories and subcategories**
